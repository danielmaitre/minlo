This directory contains a fortran 90 implementation of the flavour-kt jet algorithms,

  Eur.Phys.J. C47 (2006) 113 [hep-ph/0601139]

together with a C++ FastJet interface to them, through a plugin. 

To build the plugin, just type make (for it to work you will need to
have fastjet-config in your path, and coinciding versions of g++ and
gfortran).

An example of usage is to be found in examples/fastjet-example.cc (see
the README file in that directory and the top of the program file).
