	* FlavKtPlugin.hh|cc:
	FlavKtPlugin::Extras now has an extra member function,
	beam_it_clusters_with(jet), which returns +1, -1 or 0 according to
	whether this jet will immediately go on to cluster with the
	forward beam, backward beam, or with something other than the beam
	(or even nothing at all). Suggested by Daniel Maitre.
